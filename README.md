CDAP Integration Tests
======================
To run integration tests, execute:

`mvn test -DargLine="-DinstanceUri=<HostAndPort>"`

Integration tests are capable of running against an existing CDAP instance or against a Standalone instance if no
instance URI is provided.


TODO
----

The directory structure of this project is not well defined.
Currently, cdap-examples is not pushed to mvn, and so the application sources are copied to this project.
Additionally, the test framework API is not finalized - several things are missing such as v3 Clients, RuntimeStats
for integration tests, etc.
